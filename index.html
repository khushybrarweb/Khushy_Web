            Welcome to this horrendous site that looks like a third 
            grade threw up on it. Please excuse this ugly design, as 
            I am still learning the ropes to programming. I promise that 
            in a couple of weeks this site will be whipped into shape. 
            <br>
            This is a site I am making as an assignment for an InfoTech 
            11 class. This is where I will be showcasing all of the 
            amazing tricks that I will learn with HTML, CSS and maybe even
            JavaScript.
